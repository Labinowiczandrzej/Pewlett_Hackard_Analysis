# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

## Overview of Project
In this project I am going to show my proficiency in the use of SQL for creating tables and pulling data from a given CSV file. Specifically I will be look at employee data for the company Pewlett Hackard and compiling the data looking at 2 quantifiers. First out of the employee data I will be determining the number of retiring employees and organizing them by their title. The requirements for retirement are that the employee has to be born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955. Once that is completed I will take the original data and see out of the employees that are listed, who is eligble for the mentorship program. To qualify for the membership program the employee has to be born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1956. Once both tables have been compliled I will give an analysis of the data.
